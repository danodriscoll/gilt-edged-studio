# Model Introduction

My goal is to better understand the UK Government monetary system. I believe that building incrementally sophisticated, stock-flow consistent, agent-based monetary models will help [me](https://www.danielodriscoll.me.uk/) achieve that goal.

The agent-based (computational) models developed are are interpretations of the government money systems described by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie (G&L) in their book Monetary Economics. View a personal [reading](https://www.danielodriscoll.me.uk/reading) list of texts on monetary system design.

# Household

## Taxation and Investment Strategies

At every step a Household will decide on the amount of (wage) taxation it will pay, that is, a percentage of total tax owed on the wage received in the current step. Second, a Household will update its current wealth before deciding how much of that wealth to keep as cash money. Any remaining wealth is invested between the available portfolio of interest-bearing money assets.

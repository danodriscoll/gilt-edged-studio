A simple analysis of the *velocity* and *acceleration* of a Government money system - the new bills issued - and the correlation of model bond dynamics with real-world UK Gilt dynamics.

### Model Run Parameter Inputs


See GiltEdged [model runs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRjjK62BFLfv9bvJb9JLxP0ko_xFBoTSgA0G23Ks4cwArnmkOcT7ik57SPETeLpCQyXMzJM_RCDplop/pubhtml?gid=1130413788&single=true).

A model run free from interest payments on Government money.

### Velocity & Acceleration of Model Bills Issued

```python showLineNumbers title="velocity.py"
"""
Change in bills issued, from one period to the next,
as percentage of national income.
"""
import numpy as np

velocity_bills = np.diff(df["bills_issued"])
df["velocity_bills_issued"] = ((abs(velocity_bills)
                                / df["national_income"])
                                * 100)
```

```python showLineNumbers title="acceleration.py"
acceleration_bills = np.diff(df["velocity_bills_issued"])
```

### Analysis Notes & Charts

The [velocity](https://www.data-reports.net/gilt-edged-studio/virgo-420-23-05-2024-analysis-velocity.html) of model bills issued chart shows two periods, among others, where the *velocity* of model bills leads to a similar reaction in the real-world Gilt yield. The period between July 1997 and July 2003, however, shows the trend *velocity* of model bills issued increasing while the trend Gilt yield is decreasing. When looking at the [acceleration](https://www.data-reports.net/gilt-edged-studio/virgo-420-23-05-2024-analysis-acceleration.html) of model bills issued chart, we see that across the same period there is actually a *negative acceleration* trend occurring. The *velocity* of bills issued may be increasing, but the system is experiencing *negative acceleration* - to which Gilt yields may be reacting.

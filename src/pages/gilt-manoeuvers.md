# Gilt Manoeuvers

:::info About a Gilt

In 1694, the recently formed Bank of England gathered together 1,268 individuals to subscribe to buy 1.2 million pounds of stock yielding 8%, designed to fund King William's war with France. The bonds became known as Gilts because the certificates had gilt edges to them. In conventional gilts, the Government will pay the holder a coupon, or cash payment, every six months until maturity.

## Economic Time-Series & Random Relationships

Gilt manoeuvers analyses the macro and micro output of an evolving [ABMLP-X](docs/abmlp-x/introduction) in relation to an extremely bounded view of over three-hundred years of real-world UK events. The study of relationships and event correlations will, I hope, help me to better understand and anticipate the dynamics of English Government Gilts, present and future.

Simple data analysis of model output is performed in local [Jupyter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) notebooks. Dashboards and snapshots may change, break or disappear at any time. View a summary technical [architecture](https://www.data-reports.net/studio-sketch/architecture.html).

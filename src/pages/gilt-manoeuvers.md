# Gilt Manoeuvers

:::info About a Gilt

In 1694, the recently formed Bank of England gathered together 1,268 individuals to subscribe to buy 1.2 million pounds of stock yielding 8%, designed to fund King William's war with France. The bonds became known as Gilts because the certificates had gilt edges to them. In conventional gilts, the Government will pay the holder a coupon, or cash payment, every six months until maturity.

## Time-Series Correlation & Speculated Futures

Manoeuvers is the analysis of the macro and micro; the output of a simple, evolving, monetary system [model](docs/abmlp-x/introduction). Analysis will, I hope, help me to better understand and anticipate both agent logics and the real-world Government Gilt dynamics that result.
